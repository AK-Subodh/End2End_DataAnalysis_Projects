## Hypothesis:
- Performance matters. Hence, awards won, KPIs completed and previous year rating should affect the promotion.
-  In case of younger employees, their experience might be compensated with respect to the trainings they've went through. Hence, check the relationship between the training performance and number of hours dedicated to it by the employee and if they're promoted.
-  There could be high competitive local environment (at some offices) which might affect the performance, check if any region contributes more towards promotion of employees.
-  Level of education might play a role in promotion, check it's affect.
-  Is there any gender bias?
-  Is there any individual contribution of the department to which they belong and their promotion?

## Approch
- Getting to know the data (upload, shape, size, spread)
- Cleaning
- Test/Train csv are separate. So split train into train and cv
- Exploratory data analysis for the deeper look into the same.
- Correlation
- Encoding
- Feature Selection
- Model Building and Selection
- Checking and building pickle file
- Making app which fetches data from user using flask
- Editing HTML and CSS template for the requirements
- Freezing requirements and other files
- Deploying on Heroku
